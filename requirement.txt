Core Dependencies:
Python 3.8+

Data Processing and Model Training:
numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
tensorflow: For building and training the neural network.
scikit-learn: For metrics and preprocessing utilities.
transformers: For using BERT and tokenization.

Model Deployment:
fastapi: For creating the API endpoints.
uvicorn: For running the FastAPI server.

Model Saving and Loading:
For saving and loading model Keras format used (optionally 'h5py' to weights in HDF5 format).

Additional Dependencies:
pydantic: For data validation in FastAPI.
joblib: For saving and loading Python objects (e.g., LabelEncoders).

Installation of the dependencies:
All the dependencies ca be installed using pip. Here's a command to install them:
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn transformers fastapi uvicorn h5py pydantic joblib
